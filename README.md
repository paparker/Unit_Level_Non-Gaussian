# Unit_Level_Non-Gaussian

This repository provides example code for "[Computationally Efficient Bayesian Unit-Level Models for Non-Gaussian Data Under Informative Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.05642)" by P. Parker, S. Holan, and R. Janicki.

The data used in the paper is confidential microdata and cannot be shared, however we give a short example here using public use microdata for the 2014 American Community Survey 1-year sample in the state of Minnesota. This public use data can be found at https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/microdata/access.2014.html
